# Common Compiler Infrastructure (CCI)

## IMPORTANT
Moving forward, there will only be servicing investments in CCI to support existing uses. New projects that need related functionality should look to the following instead:

* [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) 
* [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil)
* [System.Reflection.Metadata](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)

## GitHub vs. CodePlex
This GitHub repository is the new central location for CCI and will replace https://ccimetadata.codeplex.com and https://cciast.codeplex.com.
